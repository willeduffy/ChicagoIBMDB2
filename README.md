# ChicagoIBMDB2
For the final project of IBM's Coursera course on data science and SQL with Python, I created an IBM DB2 database and populated it with various relational tables using data provided by the Chicago city government. I then conducted analysis on it in order to answer various questions using python and SQL queries.
